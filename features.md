# Juju.lol Feature List
### Not all of the features fit into discord embeds, so I figured it would be easier to put them all here.

# Supported Executors
- Solara
- Arceus
- Delta
- Codex
- Hydrogen
- Macsploit
> If your exploit is not listed, there is a good chance it's supported anyways!

# Supported Games
- Da Hood
> This includes Da Hood copies/remakes (yes, including Hood Customs with anti aim viewer and anticheat bypass etc)
- Murderers VS Sheriffs Duels
- Phantom Forces
> As of 6/23/2024, it is currently considered abandoned as there is no executor to continue working on it.

# Universal Features
### These are features, "the basics" that every Juju script comes with
- Config System
> Easily create, delete, load, save and share configs
- Addon System
> Create your own features for Juju or edit existing ones using our addon api @ https://docs.juju.lol/
- Fully Unloadable
> Unload the script with no trace with a click of a button
